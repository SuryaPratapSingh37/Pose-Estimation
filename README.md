# Pose-Estimation-using-PoseCNN
In this project I have implemented an end-to-end object pose estimator, based on PoseCNN, which consists of two stages - feature extraction with a backbone network and pose estimation represented by instance segmentation, 3D translation estimation, and 3D rotation estimation.
